There are two notebooks in this project and the Extended Abstract along with the slides for the video presentation.

CS_GY-6233_Intro_to_OS.pdf is the Extended Abstract.  

ds7389-Intro_to_OS-Presentation.pdf is the collection of slides used for the video recorded presentation. 

PULL_NIST_Data.ipynb is used to query the NIST NVD API and pull the needed data, and then output as a json file.

Int_to_OS-RESEARCH-main.ipynb is where the primary data manipulation take place.  
It is also the notebook that has the most refined helper functions, and realy is the meat of this project.

Use of google colab's Gemini integration assisted in both notebooks for code assistance.
All thought processes were refined over time and solely implmented by author.
